# Hello World

My name is Audriana and as a Front-end Developer, I am passionate about creating user-friendly and accessible websites and web applications. I work with a team of developers and designers to deliver high-quality products that meet our clients' and users' needs and expectations. My experience includes building websites and web applications that:

* Are static, using just HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript
* Utilize CMSes such as WordPress and Kentico
* Utilize the React front-end framework


Not only that but I can also update and fix any problems with your current site, including but not limited to:

* Addressing any bugs or broken parts of your site
* Making your website responsive
* Conducting accessibility audits and implementing upgrades
* Adding new custom pages or sections

I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques, and to apply them to create innovative and accessible web solutions.
