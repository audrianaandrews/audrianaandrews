# Hello World

## About Me

Hi, my name is Audriana and for over 5 years I have been building and updating accessible and SEO-friendly websites on various platforms. Websites that improve your presence on the internet so you can generate more business or help you get your message out there.

Not only do I build websites but I can also update and fix any problems you may be having including:

    Bug fixing
    Making websites responsive
    Accessibility upgrades
    Adding new custom page templates or areas

I have experience building and fixing static websites as well as websites for various CMSes such as WordPress and Kentico.
