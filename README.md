## About Me

Hi, my name is Audriana, and for over 7 years, I have been working as a front-end developer. I specialize in creating the look and feel of websites, ensuring they are user-friendly and, most importantly, accessible for different kinds of users. My experience includes building websites that:

    Bug fixing
    Making websites responsive

Not only do I build websites, but I can also update and fix any problems with your current site, including but not limited to:

    Addressing any bugs or broken parts of your site
    Making your website responsive
    Conducting accessibility audits and implementing upgrades
    Adding new custom pages or sections to your site

Currently, I am employed as a front-end developer at Sun Life.
